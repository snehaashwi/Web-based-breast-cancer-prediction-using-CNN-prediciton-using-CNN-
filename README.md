This project creates a deep learning-based system using CNNs to classify breast cancer images. A web app enables doctors to manage patient data, analyze predictions, and access records, while patients can upload CT scans for diagnostics. The app also offers doctor info for consultations and shares breast cancer news to raise awareness and educate.
